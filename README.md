# dataManager_wPredictionModels
It reads excel files and creating a table as same shape as excel file shape and takes data from excel file. Able to define independent variable (x) and dependent variable (y). Prediction models added but not functional for now. I will update it soon.

# To read/upload excel file
I added two excel files. Write file name at file name input(line edit) and click 'Set Table'.
You can use another excel files. My excel files are including random data.

# Predction Models
I created a combobox and added regression models but they are not functional for now. I will update it soon and write more clear explanation.
